# Portfolio Images Generation Spec

This document describes the prompts and style for generating portfolio images for each project using Google Imagen 4.

## General Style
- All images should look hand-sketched, with visible pencil or ink lines and an artistic, creative feel.
- No text or branding in the images.
- Color palettes should match the project theme, but remain soft and inviting.
- Each image should visually represent the core idea or technology of the project.
- **For each portfolio item, generate two images:**
  - A preview image (400x289) for the portfolio grid
  - A large modal image (1200x800) for the project details
